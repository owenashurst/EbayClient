# Ebay Client

This is an unofficial SDK to help people target the latest version of .NET (currently .NET 6) whilst also providing the same kind of functionality as the official (and might I add, old) SDK's provided by eBay that target .NET Framework.

This SDK allows cross platform applications to be written that can be deployed to the cloud.

Contributations are welcome.
